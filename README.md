# ai-for-everyone

The scope is gradually to build awareness and general expertise in AI.

The plan is to start with a plain vanilla The Hello World of ML and to move towards experiencing a different models. 
Will use available free recourses, to better understand AI applicability.

In the next 2 months, we intend to post on below:

* Model 1. Your First ML Project in Python Step-By-Step. https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
* Model 2. Regression ML
* Model 3. Binary Classification ML
* Model 4. [Quite advanced but funny] Convolutional Neural Network with Cat/Dog classification

As a main resource for this, we will use:

* https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/, 
* book https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-with-python/ 
* and some datasets from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php 

## How to Upload your Solutions

1. Fork this repo on GitHub and create a local clone on your local computer
  *  See [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo))  
  *  This step is only required for your first solution
3. Go to your local repo and create a folder for yourself under the appropriate model folder
4. Add your files to your own folder
5. Push to your fork repo
6. Submit pull request to get your files into this repo from your fork

### Keep your fork repo up to date

* See `How to keep a fork repo up to date?` in our [FAQ page](https://code-mentoring.github.io/faq/).

# ai-for-everyone

The scope is gradually to build awareness and general expertise in AI.

The plan is to start with a plain vanilla The Hello World of ML and to move towards experiencing a different models. 
Will use available free recourses, to better understand AI applicability.

In the next 2 months, we intend to post on below:

* Model 1. Your First ML Project in Python Step-By-Step. https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
* Model 2. Regression ML
* Model 3. Binary Classification ML
* Model 4. [Quite advanced but funny] Convolutional Neural Network with Cat/Dog classification

As a main resource for this, we will use:

* https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/, 
* book https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-with-python/ 
* and some datasets from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php
